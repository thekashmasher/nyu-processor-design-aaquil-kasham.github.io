## Weeks of September 1 – September 22, 2025

Project Work:
- Reviewed course slides and processor design documentation provided on the NYU Processor Design website.
- Read through the RISC-16 reference materials and example implementations to understand the overall architecture.
- Familiarized myself with the group repository structure and existing starter code.

Progress Notes:
During the first few weeks, my focus was on getting up to speed with the tools, workflow, and overall processor architecture. I spent time going through lecture slides and online documentation to understand how the 
Program Counter, register file, ALU, and memory modules are expected to interact. This helped clarify design expectations before writing any Verilog.

I also set up my local development environment and practiced running simple testbenches to ensure my toolchain was working correctly. 
Reviewing reference designs early on helped me better understand how control flow and datapath components fit together at a high level.



## Week of October 13, 2025

Project Work:
- Contributed to the group RISC-16 processor project:  
  https://github.com/clavinator7/RISC-16-Processor-Project
- Implemented the Program Counter (`pc.v`) module.
- Implemented and revised the Instruction Memory module based on feedback.
- Attended multiple group meetings (in-person and virtual) to review module interfaces and expected behavior.
- Coordinated Git workflow with teammates, including branching, committing, and merging changes.

Team Contributions:
- Calvin implemented the ALU and control module and handled repository configuration and merges.
- Louai implemented the register file and developed the data memory testbench, and frequently helped clarify Verilog and testing conventions.
- Aaquil implemented the Program Counter and Instruction Memory modules and updated them after group review and TA feedback.

What I Learned:
- Learned the importance of understanding the full processor datapath before implementing individual modules.
- Gained experience designing synchronous logic in Verilog, particularly around reset behavior and clocked updates.
- Learned that module-level testing should be done using external testbenches rather than embedding test code inside modules.
- Improved my understanding of collaborative Git workflows and how to avoid integration issues.
- Realized the value of regular communication and reviewing each other’s code to ensure consistency across the design.

Overall, this phase focused on transitioning from understanding the architecture and tools to implementing and integrating core processor modules.
